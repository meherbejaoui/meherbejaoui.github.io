Governance of the extractive industry is important to optimize resource utilization, and to ensure that the outcomes from natural resources exploitation contribute to the sustainable development of the country.  

Simultaneously obtaining higher economic revenues and better social impacts is not a simple task, and may be impeded by several practical and organizational obstacles, that focus on the present gains rather than on sustainable development.  

Governance can be improved with the right legal, institutional and administrative measures, and by applying certain best practices. They must unfold in terms of multiple reforms carried out judiciously.   

The key question addressed by this report is: *how can we improve the governance of the extractive industry in __Tunisia__?*   

This would be done as follows:   
- **Chapter 1** would address the legal framework governing the extractive industry in Tunisia. An analysis of the different legal texts, and the specific details would help contextualize and put into perspective the status quo.   

- **Chapter 2** addresses the institutional and organizational frameworks of the sector. It would present the main entities that shape the public interventions and strategies. It would also try to analyse and build on the governance of the sector from this perspective.   

- **Chapter 3** gives a broad but important idea about the current health of the sector in Tunisia, and showcases the importance of natural resources and the need for a better governance, with a focus on sustainable development.   

- **Chapter 4** deals with the challenges and opportunities in line with the sustainable development of the sector and the country. It uses different approaches and tools to enhance the structures and regulations, and the governance of the whole sector along the decision chain.
