Governance of the extractive industry is important to optimize resource utilization, and to ensure that the outcomes from natural resources exploitation contribute to the sustainable development of the country.  
Simultaneously obtaining higher economic revenues and better social impacts is not a simple task, and may be impeded by several practical and organizational obstacles, that focus on the present gains rather than on sustainable development.
